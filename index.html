                <p>
                    The Brock Public School Council is a group of parents, guardians, and community members 
                    dedicated to supporting our school and enhancing the educational experience for all students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work collaboratively with school administration, teachers, and the broader community 
                    to provide input on school policies, organize events, and support initiatives that benefit 
                    our students and school.
                </p>
